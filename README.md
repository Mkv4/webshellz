Various Web Shells I have collected back in the days and now suddenly surfaced in my data ocean...

Feel free to use, test and play around with them. I am not in any way responsible for the content of any of the provided files nor do I support any illegal activity you may conduct with these files. Most shells are detected by AV and I have no idea whether these shells have callbacks to their creators or not. Use with caution - regard them as hostile ;)

Any contribution is welcome!
